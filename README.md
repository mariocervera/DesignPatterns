# DesignPatterns

This repository contains implementations of design patterns [1]. Even though the patterns are described in [1] in object-oriented terms,
in this repository they are implemented in a procedural language: C. My sole purpose was to practice how to implement object-oriented
concepts in a non-object-oriented language [2,3]. If you simply develop end-user applications in C and you want to do object-oriented
programming, you should probably be using C++ instead of C.

Current pattern implementations in this repository:

* [State pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern): implementation of the turnstile example described in the video
lectures that are available at [Clean Coders](https://cleancoders.com/).
